Googiri - Use Google's awesome speech-to-text results with Siri.

Speak your query in the Google Search app, and if you prepend your query with a few keywords, Siri will take over handling the query.

For example, you could ask Google for the weather with "What's the weather", but if you want Siri's results instead, say "hey, Siri, what's the weather".

This works for system functions, of course. Telling Google, "remind me to take out the trash in an hour" will open Siri with your already filled in reminder card.

You can optionally set Siri as the default results engine by toggling "Send All to Siri" in the settings panel. This will send all queries from Google's Search app to Siri, unless you say "Google" (or a similar phrase) before your query.

Finally, if you prepend your query with one of the system commands, Siri will automatically take over, regardless of the setting above.

I suggest using NowNow to set Google Search as the long press home button action.
